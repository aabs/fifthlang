# Skipped: pending grammar support for standalone triple term in BGP
# Source: W3C rdf-tests/sparql/sparql12/syntax-triple-terms-positive/basic-reifier-12.rq
# Rationale: Same pattern as basic-reifier-11 requiring acceptance of <<S P O ~ R>>
#            alone inside a CONSTRUCT BGP. Grammar presently expects a predicate/object
#            following a subject unless using propertyList form.

PREFIX : <http://example.com/ns#>

CONSTRUCT WHERE {
   << :s :p :o ~ :iri >> .
}
