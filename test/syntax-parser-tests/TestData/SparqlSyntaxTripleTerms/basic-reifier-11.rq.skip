# Skipped: pending grammar support for standalone triple term in BGP
# Source: W3C rdf-tests/sparql/sparql12/syntax-triple-terms-positive/basic-reifier-11.rq
# Rationale: Our SPARQL grammar currently does not accept a lone <<S P O ~ R>> pattern
#            as a complete BGP item without a predicate/object. This is tracked and will
#            be revisited alongside validation of the W3C BNF for standalone triple terms.
