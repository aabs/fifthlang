**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before planning
**Created**: 2025-11-19
**Feature**: ./spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (conceptual, avoids internal structures)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined for core stories
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (derivable from scenarios)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (basic, assignment, overload, inheritance, generics)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items satisfied. Ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.
