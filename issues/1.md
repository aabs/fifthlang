### Problem Statement
The current AST model for IL (found in `src/ast-model/ILMetamodel.cs`) does not accurately reflect the structure of Common Intermediate Language (CIL) instructions. This misalignment is particularly evident in how statements and expressions are modeled in a higher-level abstraction and do not map closely to CIL's stack-based, instruction-level operations. Additionally, the conversion process from AST to IL AST and the subsequent code generation process need to be updated to align with this revised model.

### Proposed Solution
#### 1. Refactor the ILMetamodel
- Introduce explicit types for CIL instructions, such as:
  - `LoadInstruction`
  - `StoreInstruction`
  - `BranchInstruction`
  - `ArithmeticInstruction`
  - etc.
- Align statements and expressions with CIL's stack-based nature by:
  - Including constructs for stack operations (`Push`, `Pop`).
  - Representing control flow with instruction-level constructs like `BranchIfTrue` and `BranchIfFalse` instead of high-level constructs like `IfStatement`.

#### 2. Revise the Conversion Process
- Update the logic to convert the high-level AST into the new, instruction-level IL AST.
- Ensure that the new IL AST accurately translates all high-level constructs into corresponding CIL-like instructions.

#### 3. Update Code Generation
- Modify the code generation process to generate executable code from the new IL AST.
- Ensure compliance with the CIL standard and maintain correctness of generated code.

### Tasks
1. Refactor `ILMetamodel.cs` to introduce instruction-level constructs.
2. Update the AST-to-IL AST conversion logic to handle the new model.
3. Revise the code generation process to work with the new IL AST.
4. Write tests to validate:
   - The correctness of the IL AST model.
   - The accuracy of the conversion from AST to IL AST.
   - The correctness and compliance of generated code with CIL standards.
