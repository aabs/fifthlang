# PEEmitter Refactoring Summary - PHASE 2 IN PROGRESS

## Overview
This refactoring is modularizing the monolithic `PEEmitter.cs` (originally 2342 lines) into focused, maintainable components following the Single Responsibility Principle and proper object-oriented design.

**Phase 1 Result:** PEEmitter.cs reduced from 2342 to 821 lines (65% reduction using partial classes)  
**Phase 2 Goal:** Proper class extraction with explicit state management and comprehensive unit tests

## Refactoring Phases

### Phase 1: Partial Class Extraction (COMPLETED)
Split PEEmitter into partial classes for better organization. This reduced file size but didn't address core complexity issues.

### Phase 2: Proper Separation of Concerns (IN PROGRESS)
Convert partial classes to independent stateless classes with explicit state passing through context objects.

## Extracted Components

### Core Infrastructure

### 1. EmissionContext.cs (62 lines) - **NEW in Phase 2**
**Responsibility:** Encapsulates all state needed during PE emission

**Key Features:**
- Holds MetadataBuilder and MetadataManager
- Tracks per-method state (locals, parameters, labels)
- Enables explicit state passing instead of shared mutable state
- Uses init-only properties for immutability where possible

**Public API:**
- `MetadataBuilder` - The metadata builder for the assembly
- `MetadataManager` - Metadata lookups and registrations
- `CurrentLocalVarNames`, `CurrentParamIndexMap`, etc. - Per-method state
- `ResetMethodState()` - Clears per-method state between methods

**Design Pattern:** Context Object pattern for explicit state management

### 2. MetadataManager.cs (145 lines)
**Responsibility:** Manages all metadata lookups and registrations for types, fields, methods, and constructors.

**Key Features:**
- Centralized metadata state management
- Type, field, method, and constructor registration
- Per-method emission state tracking
- Assembly and type reference caching

**Public API:**
- `RegisterType()`, `RegisterField()`, `RegisterConstructor()`, etc.
- `TryGetType()`, `TryGetField()`, `TryGetConstructor()`, etc.
- `ResetMethodState()` for per-method state cleanup

### 2. SignatureBuilder.cs (106 lines)
**Responsibility:** Handles creation of method, parameter, and local variable signatures.

**Key Features:**
- Local variable signature creation
- Type code mapping from IL metamodel to SignatureTypeCode
- Type signature writing to blob builders

**Public API:**
- `CreateLocalVariableSignature()` - Creates signatures for local variables
- `GetSignatureTypeCode()` - Maps IL types to signature type codes
- `WriteTypeInSignature()` - Writes type info to signature blobs

### 3. SignatureUtilities.cs (91 lines)
**Responsibility:** Utility functions for parsing and extracting information from method signatures.

**Key Features:**
- Method name extraction from complex signatures
- Constructor type name extraction

**Public API:**
- `ExtractMethodName()` - Extracts method name from signature strings
- `ExtractCtorTypeName()` - Extracts type name from constructor signatures

### 4. BranchInstructionEmitter.cs (33 lines)
**Responsibility:** Handles emission of branch instructions.

**Key Features:**
- Supports br, brtrue, brfalse opcodes
- Label map management
- Error handling for missing labels

**Public API:**
- `Emit()` - Emits a branch instruction

### 5. ArithmeticInstructionEmitter.cs (80 lines)
**Responsibility:** Handles emission of arithmetic instructions.

**Key Features:**
- Binary operations: add, sub, mul, div, and, or, xor
- Comparison operations: ceq, clt, cgt, cle, cge
- Unary operations: neg, not

**Public API:**
- `Emit()` - Emits an arithmetic instruction

## Integration with PEEmitter

The PEEmitter class now:
1. Creates instances of the extracted components in its constructor
2. Delegates to specialized emitters for specific instruction types
3. Uses utility classes for signature parsing
4. Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

### Example Integration:
```csharp
// Before:
private void EmitBranchInstruction(InstructionEncoder il, BranchInstruction branchInst, ...)
{
    // 18 lines of switch/case logic
}

// After:
private void EmitBranchInstruction(InstructionEncoder il, BranchInstruction branchInst, ...)
{
    _branchEmitter.Emit(il, branchInst, labelMap);
}
```

### Instruction Emitters (Partial Classes)

### 6. PEEmitter.LoadInstructions.cs (354 lines)
**Responsibility:** Handles emission of all load instructions.

**Key Features:**
- Load constant instructions (ldc.i4, ldc.r4, ldc.r8, ldstr)
- Local variable loading (ldloc)
- Argument loading (ldarg)
- Field loading (ldfld, ldsfld)
- Array element loading (ldelem.i4, newarr)
- Stack manipulation (dup, ldnull)
- Boxing operations

**Key Methods:**
- `EmitLoadInstruction()` - Main dispatcher
- `EmitLoadLocal()` - Handles local variable loading with type inference
- `EmitLoadArgument()` - Handles argument loading
- `EmitLoadField()` - Resolves and loads instance fields
- `EmitLoadStaticField()` - Loads static fields

**Key Features:**
- External method calls with complex signature resolution
- Assembly reference management
- Type reference creation
- Method signature building
- Runtime reflection-based parameter resolution
- Support for both Fifth.System and external assemblies
- Newobj instruction handling

**Complexity Note:**
This is the largest extracted component due to the complexity of:
- Parsing extcall tokens
- Resolving external assemblies and types
- Building method signatures dynamically
- Handling various calling conventions

### 9. PEEmitter.MethodBodyEmission.cs (322 lines)
**Responsibility:** Handles method body generation and IL instruction sequence emission.

**Key Features:**

- Integration with AstToIlTransformationVisitor

**Key Methods:**
- `GenerateMethodIL()` - Main method body generation
- Stack depth tracking and validation
- Fallback value insertion for underspecified returns

## File Size Summary

### Before Refactoring
- PEEmitter.cs: **2342 lines** (monolithic)

### After Refactoring
- **PEEmitter.cs: 821 lines** (main orchestration) - **65% reduction!**
- PEEmitter.LoadInstructions.cs: 354 lines
- PEEmitter.StoreInstructions.cs: 186 lines
- PEEmitter.CallInstructions.cs: 595 lines
- PEEmitter.MethodBodyEmission.cs: 322 lines
- MetadataManager.cs: 145 lines
- SignatureBuilder.cs: 106 lines
- SignatureUtilities.cs: 91 lines
- BranchInstructionEmitter.cs: 33 lines
- ArithmeticInstructionEmitter.cs: 80 lines

**Total: 2733 lines** across 10 files (manageable overhead for significantly better maintainability)

## Benefits

### Maintainability
- Each component has a single, clear responsibility
- Easier to understand and modify individual components
- Reduced cognitive load when working with specific functionality

### Testability
- Smaller classes are easier to unit test in isolation
- Can test instruction emitters independently of PE emission
- Signature utilities can be tested with various input patterns

### Reusability
- Components can be reused in other contexts
- Instruction emitters could be used in other IL generators
- Signature utilities useful wherever IL signatures are parsed

### Readability
- PEEmitter.cs reduced from 2342 to 2209 lines (133 lines)
- Complex logic extracted into focused, named components
- Clear separation of concerns

## Testing Results

All existing tests pass with the same results as before refactoring:
- Total tests: 283
- Passed: 281
- Failed: 2 (pre-existing failures in ILEmissionValidationTests)
- No regressions introduced

## Future Refactoring Opportunities

While this refactoring successfully extracted key components, additional improvements could include:

1. **LoadInstructionEmitter** - Extract load instruction logic (currently ~320 lines in PEEmitter)
2. **StoreInstructionEmitter** - Extract store instruction logic (currently ~170 lines in PEEmitter)
3. **CallInstructionEmitter** - Extract call instruction logic (currently ~577 lines in PEEmitter)
4. **ILMethodBodyEmitter** - Extract method body generation logic
5. **Full MetadataManager integration** - Replace direct dictionary access with MetadataManager API

These extractions were deferred as they would require more extensive changes to state management and would not align with the "minimal changes" principle for this PR.

## Conclusion

This refactoring successfully modularized PEEmitter.cs while maintaining full backward compatibility and test coverage. The extracted components provide a solid foundation for future improvements and make the codebase more maintainable, testable, and understandable.

## Phase 2 Improvements: Proper Class Extraction

### New Stateless Instruction Emitters

#### LoadInstructionEmitter.cs (487 lines)
**Major Improvement:** Converted from partial class to independent stateless class

**Key Changes:**
- Accepts `EmissionContext` explicitly instead of accessing PEEmitter state
- Completely testable in isolation
- Clear dependencies visible in method signatures
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (8 tests)

**Unit Tests Added:**
- `LoadInstructionEmitterTests.cs` with 8 tests
- Tests cover: constants, strings, locals, arguments, fields, null, dup, box
- All tests verify both instruction emission and state tracking

#### StoreInstructionEmitter.cs (261 lines)
**Major Improvement:** Converted from partial class to independent stateless class

**Key Changes:**
- Accepts `EmissionContext` explicitly for state
- Proper type tracking for newobj and field loads
- Handles unknown fields gracefully with stack balancing
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (8 tests)

**Unit Tests Added:**
- `StoreInstructionEmitterTests.cs` with 8 tests
- Tests cover: locals, fields, static fields, arguments, elements
- Verifies state clearing after stores

### Architectural Benefits

**Before Phase 2:**
```csharp
// Partial class accessing shared state
public partial class PEEmitter {
    private string? _lastLoadedLocal;  // Shared mutable state
    
    private void EmitLoadInstruction(...) {
        // Directly modifies _lastLoadedLocal
        _lastLoadedLocal = varName;
    }
}
```

**After Phase 2:**
```csharp
// Independent stateless class with explicit state
public class LoadInstructionEmitter {
    public void Emit(InstructionEncoder il, LoadInstruction inst, EmissionContext context) {
        // State passed explicitly
        context.MetadataManager.LastLoadedLocal = varName;
    }
}
```

### Testing Impact

**Phase 1 (Partial Classes):**
- 0 unit tests for extracted components
- Difficult to test in isolation
- Hidden dependencies on PEEmitter state

**Phase 2 (Proper Classes):**
- 16 new unit tests (8 per emitter)
- Easy to test with mock contexts
- Clear dependencies and contracts
- **Test Results:** 297/299 passing (up from 281)

### Documentation

All Phase 2 components include:
- ✅ XML documentation for all public methods
- ✅ Parameter descriptions
- ✅ Responsibility statements in class docs
- ✅ Usage examples in tests

### Next Phase Recommendations

1. **Convert Call & MethodBody partial classes** to proper stateless classes
2. **Refactor PEEmitter** to use the new EmissionContext and emitters
3. **Add integration tests** verifying end-to-end emission
4. **Extract orchestration logic** from PEEmitter into a coordinator class
5. **Document state machine** for method emission lifecycle

## Conclusion

Phase 2 represents a significant architectural improvement:
- **Testability:** 16 new unit tests demonstrate improved testability
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns with explicit dependencies  
- **Reusability:** Stateless emitters can be used in other contexts
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive XML docs and unit test examples

The refactoring is progressing from simple file splitting (Phase 1) to proper object-oriented design with SOLID principles (Phase 2).
