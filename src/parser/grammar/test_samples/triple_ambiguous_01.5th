// T008: Ambiguity separation sample ensuring graph assertion <{ ... }> is not parsed as triple
// Purpose: Validate that a graph assertion block starting with <{ does not conflict with triple literal <s,p,o>
// and that a following valid triple literal still parses.
// intent: invalid â€” expect parse error (contains a deliberately malformed triple)

alias ex as <http://example.org/>;

main(): int {
    // Graph assertion block (expression-form assigned to a graph variable)
    g: graph = <{ <http://example.org/s> <http://example.org/p> 42; }>;

    // Valid triple literal immediately after
    t1: triple = <ex:s, ex:p, ex:o>;

    // Malformed triple (too few) to ensure TRPL001 still emitted in same file
    t2: triple = <ex:s, ex:p>;
