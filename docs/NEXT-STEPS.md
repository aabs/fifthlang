## ðŸŽ¯ Key Findings Summary

### Critical Path Issues (P0)
These block IDE integration and prevent the compiler from scaling to production use:

1. **Error Recovery (8 weeks):** Parser throws on first error; must implement resilient parsing
2. **LSP Implementation (20 weeks):** No language server = no modern IDE support
3. **Incremental Compilation (20 weeks):** Full recompilation doesn't scale; blocks LSP performance

### High Priority (P1)
Important for developer experience and maintainability:

4. **Diagnostic System (8 weeks):** Fragmented error reporting; poor error messages
5. **Composable Pipeline (10 weeks):** 18 hardcoded phases; difficult to test and optimize

### Medium Priority (P2)
Performance and quality improvements:

6. **Symbol Table (8 weeks):** O(n) lookups; no indexing for IDE features
7. **Testing Architecture (10 weeks):** Slow tests; no unit/property testing

## ðŸ“… Recommended Timeline

### Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar)
**Goal:** Foundation for IDE integration

- **Weeks 1-8:** Error Recovery + Diagnostic System
- **Weeks 1-10:** Testing Architecture (ongoing)

### Q2 2026 (Apr-Jun)  
**Goal:** Ship working Language Server

- **Weeks 9-28:** LSP Implementation (20 weeks)
- **Weeks 9-28:** Incremental Compilation (20 weeks, parallel)
- **Weeks 9-18:** Composable Pipeline (10 weeks)

### Q3 2026 (Jul-Sep)
**Goal:** Performance and quality

- **Weeks 19-26:** Symbol Table Enhancement
- **Weeks 1-26:** Continue Testing Architecture

**Total Effort:** ~84 weeks (21 months) of work
**With 2-3 developers:** ~6-9 months calendar time

## âœ… Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review the findings** with the team
   - Read `docs/architectural-review-2025.md`
   - Discuss priorities and timeline
   - Get team buy-in

2. **Create GitHub issues** from templates
   - Use the script in `docs/arch-review-issues/README.md`
   - Or create manually via GitHub web UI
   - Ensure all labels exist in the repository

3. **Set up project board**
   - Create GitHub project for "Architectural Improvements"
   - Add all issues to the board
   - Set up milestones for Q1, Q2, Q3 2026

4. **Prioritize and schedule**
   - Decide which issues to tackle first
   - Assign team members
   - Set realistic timelines

### Short Term (This Month)

1. **Start with Error Recovery (Issue #001)**
   - This is the foundation for all other work
   - Relatively contained (8 weeks)
   - Enables LSP and better diagnostics

2. **Set up Testing Infrastructure (Issue #007)**
   - Run in parallel with Error Recovery
   - Improves confidence in changes
   - Enables phase isolation

3. **Plan LSP Architecture**
   - Review Issue #002 in detail
   - Evaluate OmniSharp LSP library
   - Design service interfaces

### Medium Term (Next Quarter)

1. **Ship Error Recovery**
   - Complete implementation
   - Full test coverage
   - Update documentation

2. **Redesign Diagnostic System**
   - While Error Recovery is in progress
   - Creates foundation for great error messages

3. **Begin LSP Implementation**
   - Once Error Recovery is complete
   - Start with basic features (diagnostics, hover)

### Long Term (6-9 Months)

1. **Complete LSP with basic features**
2. **Implement Incremental Compilation**
3. **Refactor Pipeline Architecture**
4. **Ship production-ready compiler with IDE support**

## ï¿½ Operational next steps (process & hygiene)

To align with the latest build/validation discipline and keep CI green, add these recurring tasks to the teamâ€™s weekly cadence:

- Build + test validation on every substantive change
   - Run `dotnet build fifthlang.sln` (allow up to 2 minutes)
   - Run `dotnet test test/ast-tests/ast_tests.csproj` and any focused suites

- Validate examples and docs parse with current grammar
   - Run `scripts/validate-examples.fish` (fish shell) locally before pushing
   - Fix `.5th` samples that donâ€™t parse; mark intentional negatives

- Parser changes discipline
   - Update both `src/parser/grammar/FifthLexer.g4` and `FifthParser.g4`
   - Update `src/parser/AstBuilderVisitor.cs` accordingly
   - Add/update samples under `src/parser/grammar/test_samples/*.5th`
   - Run `dotnet test test/syntax-parser-tests/ -v minimal`

- Generated code policy
   - Never hand-edit `src/ast-generated/`; change `src/ast-model/*` and regenerate via `just run-generator`

- CI expectations
   - CI includes a step to validate `.5th` samples; keep docs/examples grammar-compliant to avoid parser-time regressions

These steps reflect the repositoryâ€™s constitution (`/.specify/memory/constitution.md`) and workspace `AGENTS.md` and should be considered non-negotiable gates for PR readiness.

## ï¿½ðŸš€ Success Criteria

By end of Q3 2026, the compiler should have:

- âœ… Resilient parser with error recovery
- âœ… Working Language Server with basic features
- âœ… Incremental compilation (10x+ speedup)
- âœ… High-quality error messages (like Rust)
- âœ… Composable pipeline architecture
- âœ… Fast symbol lookups (O(1))
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)

## ðŸ’¡ Final Thoughts

The Fifth language compiler has a **solid foundation** but requires **significant architectural investment** to compete with modern languages. The three critical issues (Error Recovery, LSP, Incremental Compilation) form a **critical path** that must be addressed for the language to succeed.

**Good news:** The issues are well-understood and have clear solutions based on proven compiler design patterns. With dedicated effort, Fifth can have best-in-class tooling within 6-9 months.

**Recommendation:** Start with Error Recovery (foundational) and Testing Architecture (enables confidence), then move to LSP (biggest impact on adoption).
